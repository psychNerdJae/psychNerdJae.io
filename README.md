If you're interested in building your own site, the [Distill documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) is great for getting started quickly.

There's a [great tutorial here](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-postcards-distill/) by Alison Hill on using Sean Kross' [`postcards` package](https://github.com/seankross/postcards) to build a homepage, then using Distill to build the rest of the site.
