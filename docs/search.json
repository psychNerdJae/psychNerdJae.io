I\ntake pride in being an instructor who challenges students to grow, and\nmore importantly, an instructor who inspires students to seek\nopportunities to be challenged. I don’t always get the balance right\n(I’ve still got a lot of growing to do!), but I’m heartened to see that\nI sometimes do.\nI was honored to be one of four recipients of the 2022 Presidential\nAward for Excellence in Teaching at Brown, which “recognizes\noutstanding pedagogical achievement by a Brown University graduate\nstudent.”\nTechnical workshops\nHDDM\nSince 2018, I have been a guest workshop instructor for the\nComputational Modeling Workshop (sponsored by the Carney Institute for\nBrain Sciences at Brown University). In 2021, I was also invited to\npresent at the Computational Psychiatry Course hosted by the\nTranslational Neuromodeling Unit in Zurich, Switzerland, at which I\ndelivered an introductory lecture and taught a hands-on workshop.\nMy workshop introduces participants to the drift diffusion model\n(DDM), a computational model of decision-making that leverages\ninformation about choices and reaction times to characterize\nevidence/value accumulation. The workshop materials show participants\nhow to use HDDM, which estimates DDM parameters in a hierarchical\nBayesian framework, and are designed for people who have relatively\nlittle experience with either programming or computational modeling. All\nmaterials are free and open, and can be accessed at this GitHub\nrepository.\nAttendees of the Brown workshop have provided positive feedback about\nthis workshop. One attendee wrote that one of the things they found most\nhelpful was to “see how people (such as Jae) apply [modeling] in their\nresearch.” With regards to my hands-on session, an attendee wrote that\n“It [is] helpful to reinforce what steps you should go through when you\nmodel. Jae had this as a part of their presentation, and it was really\nhelpful.” When writing about their favorite parts of the workshop, an\nattendee wrote that “Breakout sessions were very helpful - especially\nDDM sessions hosted by Jae-Young Son and Mads Lund Pederson.”\nData science and statistics\nIn 2019, I taught a weekly workshop for undergraduates enrolled in\nthe class Personality and Clinical Assessment. None of the students had\npast experience with programming or statistics, but all successfully\nlearned how to perform essential data wrangling, visualization, and\nstatistical procedures (including mixed-effects regression).\nSince then, I have developed more extensive materials for teaching R (using\ntidyverse) and statistics.\nAll materials are free and open.\nOne of my students created a heartwarming diagram depicting how much\nthey learned about statistics, and their desire to learn more:\n\n\n\nComputational modeling\nI have also written an introductory tutorial series for computational\nmodeling using R, which covers utility modeling (risk and ambiguity\npreferences), reinforcement learning, and DIY regression. In principle,\nthis series provides enough of a gentle introduction that a beginner\ncould become self-proficient in learning more advanced modeling\ntechniques, and in learning about other classes of cognitive\ncomputational models. All materials are free and open.\nClassroom instruction\nMind, Brain, and Behavior (Summer 2021, Teaching\nAssistant)\nConsistently prepared: 4.74/5\nEffectively engaged students: 4.44/5\nResponsive to students: 4.74/5\nMade content clear and understandable: 4.58/5\nProvided clear feedback on assignments that improved learning:\n4.58/5\nOverall rating of effectiveness: 4.58/5\nQualitative feedback:\n“Always presented the information in a well-paced understandable\nmanner and was always encouraging us to participate more.”\n“Encouraging us to think through ideas for ourselves and participate\nhelped to gain a better grasp on scientific writing.”\n“His presentations were clear and simple, and he communicated\ninformation effectively.”\n“Jae provided clear feedback to the response papers, and this\nallowed me to improve my writing.”\n“Willing to answer questions and encouraging attitude”\n\n\nSocial Psychology (Fall 2020, Teaching Assistant)\nConsistently prepared: 4.51/5\nEffectively engaged students: 4.17/5\nResponsive to students: 4.34/5\nMade content clear and understandable: 4.28/5\nProvided clear feedback on assignments that improved learning:\n4.2/5\nOverall rating of effectiveness: 4.2/5\nQualitative feedback:\n“The lecture he taught was very entertaining and informative, and it\nwas one of my favorite lectures during the course. Jae is particularly\nskilled at simplifying complicated topics and answering confusing\nquestions.”\n“He always answers questions and welcomes intellectual questions. He\nexplained concepts extremely well (like during the one lecture that he\ntaught).”\n“Jae gave probably the best TA lecture I’ve ever had at Brown—great\njob!”\n“Jae consistently answered questions on Piazza with speed and\nclear/helpful answers. During office hours, he was patient and helped\nstudents come to their own conclusion by asking thought-provoking\nquestions. His passion for psychology was very clear and helped motivate\nstudents to engage deeper with the course content.”\n“His ability to redirect questions back at you in an extremely\neffective way is unmatched. His way of explaining concepts is great, and\nhe always makes sure that you understand a question he’s attempted to\nanswer before moving on.”\n“He gives great feedback that guides students to do better rather\nthan simply giving them the answer. I especially love the lecture that\nhe gave and the fact that he brought in real world issues and at the\nsame time made it relatable and understandable.”\n“He did an excellent job during his guest lecture (I thought that\nlecture had some of the most challenging content, but Jae broke down the\nconcepts and made everything really clear), which was one of the most\nmemorable lectures for me.”\n“The only reason I only agreed with the questions for the other TA’s\nwas to demonstrate how much Jae meant to this course. He continually\nworked to ensure that our concerns and questions were addressed both in\nlecture and on piazza. I felt much calmer thanks to Jae’s approach to\nteaching.”\n\n\nPersonality and Clinical Assessment (Fall 2019,\nTeaching Assistant)\nConsistently prepared: 4.95/5\nEffectively engaged students: 4.95/5\nResponsive to students: 4.9/5\nMade content clear and understandable: 4.86/5\nProvided clear feedback on assignments that improved learning:\n4.82/5\nOverall rating of effectiveness: 4.91/5\nQualitative feedback:\n“Always available to help and consistently looked for ways to make\nus understand more about statistics”\n“Extremely well-spoken and down-to-earth … I always felt able to ask\nhim questions and seek his guidance on issues.”\n“His eagerness to help student’s problems with challenges throughout\nthe course is an attribute that is very helpful and very effective”\n“Jae has an engaging, encouraging teaching style. He makes an effort\nto understand each student’s perspective, and he prompts students to\nanswer their own questions by providing gentle guidance”\n“Amazing so willing to help & go out of his way to take the time\nto help you succeed. A big reason I was able to learn so much &\nsucceed in this class”\n“He challenged us by being critical of our ideas when required, but\nalso gave us the assistance we needed to go through with more\ncomplicated analyses.”\n“Jae is awesome! His passion and knowledge about research is clear.\nHe takes great interest in students’ ideas and is so helpful in\nexplaining to students why they are doing what they are doing and\nprobing students to think about the research design of their project. He\nputs a lot of effort into grading and his comments are so helpful. His\nattitude and kind spirit also make him incredibly approachable and made\nme feel like research is a fun endeavor, which motivated me to want to\nknow why I was doing what I was doing and think critically.”\n“Extremely effective in explaining things as necessary to understand\nnew concepts, challenging us to think in new ways instead of just giving\nus the answer.”\n\n\nLeadership Alliance\nIn the summers of 2020 and 2021, I was a “study group” leader for The Leadership Alliance,\nan organization that provides research and professional development\nopportunities to students from historically excluded and minoritized\nbackgrounds. I worked with cohorts affiliated with the Carney Institute\nfor Brain Science. In our weekly sessions, we talked about different\naspects of the “hidden curriculum” in academia, strategies for\nsucceeding as a researcher, and developing scientific skills (e.g.,\nwriting an abstract, creating a research poster, etc.)\nTo hear more about these students’ transformative experiences, you\ncan read this\nperspective piece and this article from\nBrown News.\n\n\n\n",
