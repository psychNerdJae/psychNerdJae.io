<p>About a month ago, a website called “The Best Schools” published a list entitled “<a href="https://thebestschools.org/features/most-influential-psychologists-world/">The 50 Most Influential Living Psychologists in the World</a>.” Readers immediately noticed that there was a disturbing lack of Martian psychologists included on this list (after all, they didn’t specify that “in the world” had to refer to Earth!).</p>
<p>Far less amusing was the number of women and people-of-color (POC) who were chosen to represent “influential” living psychologists. By my count, 78% of those listed were male, and 100% of them were white. I want to stress that all of the individuals included on that list are brilliant scientists who have certainly made important impacts on the field - it is not my goal to diminish their accomplishments.</p>
<p>However, as a POC psychologist-in-training, I was inspired to crowdsource a new list of influential living psychologists, one that highlighted the lives and accomplishments of important female and POC figures who had been previously overlooked. In other words, for those of us who look at such lists and think, “Is there room in this field for people who look like me?”, my goal is to <em>expand</em> the record, not to <em>correct</em> it.</p>
<p>I want to caveat that this list should not be taken as any sort of “big-t” Truth. It reflects the (undoubtedly idiosyncratic) inclinations of a select group of Twitter users. (As a concrete example, I observed a few instances in which individuals’ nominations consisted exclusively of professors from their own affiliated university!) But I do believe that it captures some amount of “little-t” truth, and it gives us hope for a future in which individuals from historically-marginalized backgrounds are increasingly well-represented in our science.</p>
<p>In total, there were a stunning <strong>396 unique individuals</strong> who received nominations. Most of them had not been previously included on the list published by “The Best Schools.” Although I had originally intended to identify the top 50, my current list consists of 71 individuals due to ties (and I’d rather err on the side of celebrating more people’s accomplishments than fewer!). They are listed below in alphabetical order. Descriptions were pulled and lightly edited from nominees’ personal websites and/or Wikipedia.</p>

<p><strong>Renée Baillargeon</strong><br>
Dr.&nbsp;Baillargeon’s research focuses on early causal reasoning in four core domains: physical reasoning, psychological reasoning, biological reasoning, and sociomoral reasoning. She assumes that each domain is equipped with a skeletal explanatory framework that enables infants to reason and learn about events in the domain.</p>

<p><strong>Mahzarin Banaji</strong><br>
Dr.&nbsp;Banaji studies thinking and feeling as they unfold in social context, with a focus on mental systems that operate in implicit or unconscious mode. She studies social attitudes and beliefs in adults and children, especially those that have roots in group membership. She explores the implications of her work for questions of individual responsibility and social justice in democratic societies.</p>

<div class="quarto-layout-cell" style="flex-basis: 75.0%;justify-content: center;">
<p><strong>Lisa Feldman Barrett</strong><br>
Dr.&nbsp;Barrett’s theory of constructed emotion hypothesizes that “anger,” “sadness,” “fear,” and similar mental events are not basic building blocks in the mind, but instead are mental events that result from the dynamic interplay of more basic brain networks that are not themselves specific to emotion. Her lab studies how emotions emerge from prediction signals in the brain that function as concepts to categorize incoming sensory inputs from the body and the surrounding context, constructing experiences and perceptions of emotion.</p>

<p><strong>Dorothy Bishop</strong><br>
Dr.&nbsp;Bishop researches language impairments in children. In some cases, language difficulties have an obvious cause, such as hearing loss or a condition such as Down’s syndrome. In other cases, children have particular difficulty learning to talk or understand language for no obvious reason. Professor Bishop has studied children with ‘specific language impairment’ or SLI, who make up around 3% of the population but tend to be neglected by researchers. Using twin studies, she has investigated the genetic component to these disorders, and has worked with molecular geneticists to find out which genes are involved.</p>

Dr.&nbsp;Duckworth’s research focuses on two traits that predict achievement: grit and self-control. Grit is the tendency to sustain interest in and effort toward very long-term goals. Self-control is the voluntary regulation of impulses in the presence of momentarily gratifying temptations. On average, individuals who are gritty are more self-controlled, but the correlation between these two traits is not perfect: Some individuals are paragons of grit but not self-control, and some exceptionally well-regulated individuals are not especially gritty.</p>

Through interdisciplinary collaborations and a wide ranging array of methods—from laboratory studies to novel field experiments—Dr.&nbsp;Eberhardt has revealed the startling, and often dispiriting, extent to which racial imagery and judgments suffuse our culture and society, and in particular shape actions and outcomes within the domain of criminal justice.</p>

Society’s cultural stereotypes and prejudice also depend on relationships of power and interdependence. Group status and competition affect how groups are (dis)liked and (dis)respected. In cultural surveys, she examines the content of group stereotypes based on race, gender, age, (dis)ability, income, and more, finding patterns in the ways that society views various groups.</p>

<p><strong>V.S. Ramachandran</strong><br>
Dr.&nbsp;Ramachandran is Director of the Center for Brain and Cognition, which has two distinct agendas—a practical one and a theoretical one. The practical goal is to help develop new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric patients, e.g., chronic pain, stroke, anorexia and childhood autism. The theoretical agenda is to understand the neural basis of human behavior: the question of how the activity of the human brain gives rise to all the richness of our conscious experience.</p>

Through her teaching and research, Richeson hopes to contribute to a better understanding of intergroup relations, including how best to foster culturally diverse environments that are cohesive.</p>

Dr.&nbsp;Santos explores the evolutionary origins of the human mind by comparing the cognitive abilities of human and non-human primates. Her studies focus on a number of different primate species and incorporate methodologies from cognitive development and cognitive neuroscience. Her research examines the following broad questions: what domains of knowledge are unique to the human mind? Given that human infants and non-human primates both lack language, what similarities and differences do we see in the expression of non-linguistic domains of knowledge?</p>

How do developmental disorders, like autism, affect brain development? She often asks these questions in the domain of social cognition: how people think about people.</p>
