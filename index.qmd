I am a **social** and **cognitive** neuroscientist with interconnected interests in

- how people make decisions in a complex social world
- how the brain represents memories of networks, and also networks of memories

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with [Serra Favila](https://sites.brown.edu/favila-lab/) at Brown University. Formerly, I worked with [Oriel FeldmanHall](https://www.feldmanhalllab.com/) as a PhD student.
