It was last updated on 2022-11-30 using R Markdown.\n\nJust wanted to note that I've uploaded some [tutorial slides](2021_academic_website_tutorial.pdf) about creating an academic website.\n\nEvery grad student should have a web presence! I'm absolutely gung-ho about this. Even if you don't have any knowledge of web development, it's easy (and free!) to create your own academic site. This was one of the big things I kept pestering our department about over several years, because I think it's so important to have this information centrally available on our department website. Thanks to the efforts of our amazing IT manager Pedro, [our grad student page](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/graduate-students) finally links to our personal pages!\n",
