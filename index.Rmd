## Research

### Cognitive maps of social networks

I study how we navigate the great blooming buzzing confusion of the social world.

Social networks are vast, complex, and ever-evolving. Despite this, we are able to mentally represent the structure of our networks, and to draw upon this knowledge to make sophisticated social decisions. One of the major focuses of my research is therefore examining how people build cognitive maps of social environments.

### Approach

I use computational modeling tools to make sense of behavioral and neural data. Ongoing and past work have used:

- social network analysis
- representational similarity analysis
- reinforcement learning
- drift diffusion modeling
