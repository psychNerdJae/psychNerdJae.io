## About me

I study how we navigate the great blooming buzzing confusion of the social world.

Misadventurer; reluctant optimist; amor fati.

My name is 손재영. In English, I go by Jae. Learn more about Korean naming conventions [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_name). Hear how my full name is pronounced [here](https://translate.google.com/?sl=kr&tl=en&text=%EC%86%90%EC%9E%AC%EC%98%81&op=translate).

  \"One-dimensional thought is systematically promoted by the makers of politics and their purveyors of mass information.
  Their universe of discourse is populated by self-validating hypotheses which, incessantly and monopolistically repeated,
  become hypnotic definitions or dictations.\" -Herbert Marcuse.
